#### wsh


`wsh` is a simple library for representing vector art.  It aims to be a
lossless, data rich format for preserving digital drawing.

At the moment, it only contains some raw code.  Soon it will hopefully include
a specification, some demos, and some interchange plugins.

The standard is very much in the alpha phase, and things will definitely be changing.

There is an attendant drawing program in the works "wash" that produces artwork
using this library.

(link to companion library `brsh` ?)
links and technical writeups coming soon.
